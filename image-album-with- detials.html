					<p class="align-middle">Kengal Hanumanthaiah is credited with the conception and construction of the Vidhana Soudha.
						[4]The foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and
						 then chief minister K.C Reddy, on July 13, 1951.[5] However, it was Hanumanthaiah who was 
						 instrumental in the redesign and speedy construction of Vidhana Soudha. He visited Europe,
						 Russia, the United States, and other places and got the idea of building the Vidhana Soudha
						 by incorporating various designs from the buildings he had seen. It was completed in 1956.
						 He took a lot of interest and effort in building this marvelous granite building. It was meant
						 to dwarf the British-built Athara Kacheri (High Court) building.[6] Hanumanthaiah was criticized
						 for the nearly 15 million rupees spent to construct the building.[7] But the building designed 
						 by him is an outstanding structure of Neo Dravidian style. The land area is 60 acres.</p>
